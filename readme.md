# Stvff's Image Splicer
See [my project page](https://handmade.network/p/434/stvff-s-image-splicer/) for updates.\
Often, I want to crop an image to a very specific size in a specific way, or add an image to an image,
or do something to an image that I consider trivial, but that most basic image editors don't provide in the way I would really like it to be.\
MS Paint did a lot of things really well in my opinion, but it sometimes misses out on those few extra things, Krita is a nice fully-featured editor,
but somewhat slow, and had a lot of options directly in your face, that aren't all very clear.

Why complain about vaguely defined things, when you have the power to try to make exactly the thing you want? In this case, I've never made a proper app/program with full graphical
user interface, so maybe all these other developers are running into some fundamental UX/UI problem, that I just haven't realized.\
So, for this year's (2023) [Wheel Reinvention Jam](https://handmade.network/jam/2023), I am making this image splicer/editor utility program.\

My preliminary intended features and goals are the following:
- images on top of images on top of an optional background
- resize, rotate, translate(, maybe transform)
- a good history for undo, and having good control over what 'edits' are done exactly
- everything can be done fully with both mouse-only and keyboard-only
- every setting must have the option of an editable value (as opposed to, for example, only a slider)
- no million buttons overwhelming UI
- support for at least png, jpg and qoi

Of those, I can't be sure of how many I can complete in a week, but if I do, and after the Jam is over, the following features are also very desirable:
- drawing functions
  - straight lines
  - curves (bezier, radius)
  - basic shapes (rectangle, circle, etc)
  - fill bucket
  - free-form selection
  - text
- a port to android (this is not really a feature, but it is extremely desirable)

Everything will be incredibly rough around the corners, but I at least want something on the table for my own sake, and for others to look at.\

I also hope to think of a better name at some point.
